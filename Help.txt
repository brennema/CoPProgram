This is a help window for the Centre of Pressure Processing Program.

This program was created by Elora Brenneman and Anthony Gatti for 
Dr. Marla Beauchamp.  It is not to be distributed elsewhere without 
the consent of the original creators.  They can be contacted at:

This program takes raw voltage data collected from AMTI OR6-7 force plates 
and returns variables of interest related to centre of pressure. 
Specifcally, centre of pressure position (m), velocity (m/s), and 
mutli-scale entropy are calculated and available for export.  To run the 
program, a working directory (directory containing trials to be processed) 
must be pulled into the program using one of two methods: through the File
menu, or using the shortcut Ctrl+D.  Once the directory is listed in the 
'Set-up Processing Parameters' tab, the desired trial can be chosen using 
one of three methods: directly clicking on the trial in the directory list, 
through the File menu, or by using the shortcut Ctrl+O.  A pop-up message 
will ask the user to confirm the chosen trial.  Once confirmed, the trial 
name will appear in the text box near the 'Process Trial' button.  Next, 
a force plate must be chosen.  The force plate origin (x, y, z) will 
populate and a figure indicating the chosen force plate will appear.  The 
'Process Trial' button will process the data.  All results 
(mean/SD/COV/min/max, figures) Will appear in the 'Results' tab.  Finally, 
any desired outputs can be saved by indicating checkmarks in the boxes 
next to the variables of interest.  Pressing the 'Save' button will save 
these results in the same directory as the original trials.  For more 
information, contact Elora or Anthony.
